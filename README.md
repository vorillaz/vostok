Vostok is minimalistic build and development system for Node.js. Inspired by ZEIT's [now dev](https://zeit.co/docs/now-cli#commands/dev), Yarn [workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), Vostok lets you develop modern Node.js apps and services with meaningful and robust architecture.

Vostok is a development first solution for monorepos, projects consuming microservices even huge single page applications. Instead of bundling, watching and transpiling every single piece of code in your project using Vostok you can split your architecture into meaningful and reusable parts. You just need a configuration file and some your favorite library or framework.
